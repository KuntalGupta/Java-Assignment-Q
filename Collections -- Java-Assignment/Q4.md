Consider the four core interfaces, Set, List, Queue, and Map. For each of the following four assignments, specify which of the four core interfaces is best-suited, and explain how to use it to implement the assignment.

- *Whimsical Toys Inc (WTI) needs to record the names of all its employees. Every month, an employee will be chosen at random from these records to receive a free toy.*<br />
We can choose a random employee from a "list" by picking the indexes between 0 and size()-1. 

- *WTI has decided that each new product will be named after an employee but only first names will be used, and each name will be used only once. Prepare a list of unique first names.* <br />
We can use a "Set" since Set interface collections only allow unique elements to be entered.

- *WTI decides that it only wants to use the most popular names for its toys. Count up the number of employees who have each first name.* <br />
We can use a "Map" with first names as keys and counts of the number of employees with that first name as values. 


-  *WTI acquires season tickets for the local lacrosse team, to be shared by employees. Create a waiting list for this popular sport* <br /> 
We can utilise a "Queue" for this. We can use add() and remove() to add and remove employees from the waiting list.
